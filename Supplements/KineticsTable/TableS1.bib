abstract = {Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines. Human liver NNMT activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation which raises the possibility that this enzyme activity might be regulated by a genetic polymorphism, a polymorphism that could have functional implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity. As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, we set out to clone and express a cDNA for human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT was partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, subjected to limited proteolysis, and partial amino acid sequence information was obtained. The polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify a 550-nucleotide sequence with human liver cDNA as template and primers designed on the basis of the NNMT amino acid sequence. The 5'- and 3'-ends of a human liver NNMT cDNA were obtained by use of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The combined use of these approaches resulted in the isolation of a human liver NNMT cDNA that was 969 nucleotides in length, with a 792-nucleotide open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The human liver NNMT cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated with a reticulocyte lysate system to yield a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa that comigrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with photoaffinity-labeled human liver NNMT. The NNMT cDNA was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B). COS-1 cells transfected with this construct expressed a high level of NNMT enzymatic activity, and the biochemical properties of this activity were similar to those of human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT and transfected COS-1 cell NNMT had apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction, nicotinamide and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, of 0.43 and 0.38 mM and of 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. IC50 values for the inhibition of NNMT by N1-methylnicotinamide were 60 and 30 microns for human liver and COS-1 cell-expressed NNMT, respectively. Cloning of a cDNA for human liver NNMT will help make it possible to test the hypothesis that inheritance may play a role in the regulation of individual differences in human liver NNMT activity.},

abstract = {Nicotinamide methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.1) has been purified over 1300-fold from porcine liver. The enzyme is electrophoretically homogeneous, exhibiting a relative molecular mass of 27,000. In addition to acting on nicotinamide and close structural analogs such as thionicotinamide and 3-acetylpyridine, the enzyme actively accommodates poor analogs such as quinoline, isoquinoline, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline as methyl group acceptors. The enzyme may thus have the function of detoxicating numerous alkaloids in vivo. In some cases, the action of the enzyme might paradoxically increase the toxicities of substrates, but the hepatotoxic antibiotic pyrazinamide, which we considered as potentially such an enzyme-activated electrophile, did not function detectably as a substrate for the isolated enzyme.},

@article{Berger2005,
abstract = {Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is the central enzyme of the NAD biosynthetic pathway. Three human NMNAT isoforms have recently been identified, but isoform-specific functions are presently unknown, although a tissue-specific role has been suggested. Analyses of the subcellular localization confirmed NMNAT1 to be a nuclear protein, whereas NMNAT2 and -3 were localized to the Golgi complex and the mitochondria, respectively. This differential subcellular localization points to an organelle-specific, nonredundant function of each of the three proteins. Comparison of the kinetic properties showed that particularly NMNAT3 exhibits a high tolerance toward substrate modifications. Moreover, as opposed to preferred NAD+ synthesis by NMNAT1, the other two isoforms could also form NADH directly from the reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide, supporting a hitherto unknown pathway of NAD generation. A variety of physiological intermediates was tested and exerted only minor influence on the catalytic activities of the NMNATs. However, gallotannin was found to be a potent inhibitor, thereby compromising its use as a specific inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase. The presence of substrate-specific and independent nuclear, mitochondrial, and Golgi-specific NAD biosynthetic pathways is opposed to the assumption of a general cellular NAD pool. Their existence appears to be consistent with important compartment-specific functions rather than to reflect simple functional redundance.},

abstract = {Human nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT, EC 2.4.2.12) catalyzes the reversible synthesis of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PP i) from nicotinamide (NAM) and alpha- d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). NAMPT, by capturing the energy provided by its facultative ATPase activity, allows the production of NMN at product:substrate ratios thermodynamically forbidden in the absence of ATP. With ATP hydrolysis coupled to NMN synthesis, the catalytic efficiency of the system is improved 1100-fold, substrate affinity dramatically increases ( K m (NAM) from 855 to 5 nM), and the K eq shifts -2.1 kcal/mol toward NMN formation. ADP-ATP isotopic exchange experiments support the formation of a high-energy phosphorylated intermediate (phospho-H247) as the mechanism for altered catalytic efficiency during ATP hydrolysis. NAMPT captures only a small portion of the energy generated by ATP hydrolysis to shift the dynamic chemical equilibrium. Although the weak energetic coupling of ATP hydrolysis appears to be a nonoptimized enzymatic function, closer analysis of this remarkable protein reveals an enzyme designed to capture NAM with high efficiency at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. NMN is a rate-limiting precursor for recycling to the essential regulatory cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD (+)). NMN synthesis by NAMPT is powerfully inhibited by both NAD (+) ( K i = 0.14 muM) and NADH ( K i = 0.22 muM), an apparent regulatory feedback mechanism.},

abstract = {Nicotinamidases catalyze the hydrolysis of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid and ammonia. Nicotinamidases are absent in mammals but function in NAD(+) salvage in many bacteria, yeast, plants, protozoa, and metazoans. We have performed structural and kinetic investigations of the nicotinamidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pnc1). Steady-state product inhibitor analysis revealed an irreversible reaction in which ammonia is the first product released, followed by nicotinic acid. A series of nicotinamide analogues acting as inhibitors or substrates were examined, revealing that the nicotinamide carbonyl oxygen and ring nitrogen are critical for binding and reactivity. X-ray structural analysis revealed a covalent adduct between nicotinaldehyde and Cys167 of Pnc1 and coordination of the nicotinamide ring nitrogen to the active-site zinc ion. Using this structure as a guide, the function of several residues was probed via mutagenesis and primary (15)N and (13)C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on V/K for amide bond hydrolysis. The KIE values of almost all variants were increased, indicating that C-N bond cleavage is at least partially rate limiting; however, a decreased KIE for D51N was indicative of a stronger commitment to catalysis. In addition, KIE values using slower alternate substrates indicated that C-N bond cleavage is at least partially rate limiting with nicotinamide to highly rate limiting with thionicotinamide. A detailed mechanism involving nucleophilic attack of Cys167, followed by elimination of ammonia and then hydrolysis to liberate nicotinic acid, is discussed. These results will aid in the design of mechanism-based inhibitors to target pathogens that rely on nicotinamidase activity.},

abstract = {Initial-rate and product inhibition studies revealed distinctive ordered ternary complex kinetic mechanisms, substrate specificities, and metal ion preferences for the three isozymes of human nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase (NMNAT, EC 2.7.7.1). ATP binds before NMN with nuclear isozyme NMNAT1 and Golgi apparatus NMNAT2, but the opposite order is observed with the mitochondrial isozyme NMNAT3. Only the latter utilizes ITP efficiently in place of ATP, and while NMNH conversion to NADH by NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 occurs at similar rates, conversion by NMNAT2 is much slower. These isozymes can also be discriminated by their action on tiazofurin monophosphate (TrMP), a metabolite of the antineoplastic prodrug tiazofurin. Our finding that TrMP is only a substrate with NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 reveals for the first time an organelle selectivity in the metabolism of this important drug. In search of additional ways to discriminate these isozymes, we synthesized and tested the P1-(nicotinamide/nicotinate-riboside-5')-Pn-(adenosine-5') dinucleotides Np3AD, Np4AD, and Nap4AD. In addition to being highly effective inhibitors, these multisubstrate geometric inhibitors gave inhibition patterns that are consistent with the aforementioned isozyme differences in substrate binding order. Distinctive differences in their substrate specificity and metal ion selectivity also permitted us to quantify individual isozyme contributions to NAD+ formation in human cell extracts.},

@article{Yan1987,
abstract = {Nicotinamide deamidase (YNDase) has been purified from yeast through the use of a six-step procedure that includes molecular-sieve high performance liquid chromatography. The final preparation was homogeneous by the criteria of sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and the enzyme specific activity was determined to be 175 mumol of nicotinate formed per min/mg enzyme. Gel electrophoresis and molecular-sieve high performance liquid chromatography were employed also to characterize YNDase as a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 34,000. A Km value for nicotinamide of 33 microM was determined for the deamidase activity at pH 6, and a pH range for optimal stability of 6-8.5 was established for this enzyme. The YNDase activity was also examined over a pH range at several substrate concentrations and both the log Vmax and log Vmax/Km plots versus pH suggested that a protonated amino acid residue with an apparent pKb value of 7.8 was essential to this activity. During an in vitro assay of the YNDase-catalyzed formation of nicotinate, ammonia was generated and detected chemically. Inhibition of the YNDase activity by nicotinaldehyde suggested the presence of either an essential lysine (Schiff's base formation) or cysteine residue (thiohemiacetal intermediate) at the YNDase active site. The relatively large value of the nicotinaldehyde inhibition constant (Ki = 68 microM), the observation that this analogue is a noncompetitive inhibitor of nicotinate formation, and the fact that this inhibition can be rendered irreversible through incubation with sodium borohydride, indicates that a Schiff's base intermediate is more likely to occur upon incubation of YNDase with nicotinaldehyde. However, YNDase is inactivated completely and irreversibly by N-ethylmaleimide at pH 6, and the enzyme is protected against this modification by either nicotinamide or nicotinate. These results suggest that both nicotinate and nicotinamide bind to YNDase, even though the enzymatic reaction is essentially irreversible, and that a cysteine residue may be present at the YNDase active site.},

abstract = {A new procedure has been designed for the purification of nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase from the same baker's yeast extract. Using purified nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, the enzyme-catalyzed formation of nicotinate mononucleotide was analyzed using a new high pressure liquid chromatographic assay (Hanna, L., and Sloan, D. L. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 103, 230-234). Initial velocity measurements and product inhibition studies, with pyrophosphate, were performed. In addition, this assay procedure was used to demonstrate that purified nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase possesses an ATPase activity in the presence of either product (pyrophosphate or nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN] but in the absence of 5-phosphoribosyl alpha-1-pyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP). Moreover, exchanges of radioactivity between specific substrate/product pairs [( 14C]nicotinate/NaMN and [32P]PPi/P-Rib-PP) in the absence of other substrates were not observed when these pairs were incubated with nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, and binding of [14C] nicotinate to nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase was not detected in the presence of ATP. In contrast, an exchange of label between ATP and [14C]ADP was characterized in the absence of other substrates and in the presence of either P-Rib-PP or PPi. These results indicate that nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase proceeds through the use of an ordered Uni Uni Bi Ter Ping Pong kinetic mechanism during which ATP reacts with nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase to form ADP and a previously described phosphorylated enzyme (Kosaka, A., Spivey, H. O., and Gholson, R. K. (1977) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 179, 334-341). Thereafter, P-Rib-PP and nicotinate bind in order to the active site, to produce PPi and NaMN which are released in a random order followed by Pi. The Km values for ATP, P-Rib-PP, and nicotinate were calculated to be 70 +/- 10, 24 +/- 3, and 23 +/- 4 microM, respectively, whereas a value for Ki(PRPP) of 5 +/- 1 microM was determined.},

abstract = {The kinetic properties of highly purified human placental cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase were investigated. Initial velocity studies gave Michaelis constants for AMP, IMP, and CMP of 18, 30, and 2.2 microM, respectively. The enzyme shows the following relative Vmax values: CMP greater than UMP greater than dUMP greater than GMP greater than AMP greater than dCMP greater than IMP. The activity was magnesium-dependent, and this cation binds sequentially with a Km of 14 microM for AMP and an apparent Km of 6 mM for magnesium. A large variety of purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine compounds exert an inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. IMP, GMP, and NADH produce almost 100\% inhibition at 1.0 mM. Nucleoside di- and triphosphates are potent inhibitors. ATP and ADP are competitive inhibitors with respect to AMP and IMP as substrates with Ki values of 100 and 15 microM, respectively. Inorganic phosphate is a noncompetitive inhibitor with Ki values of 19 and 43 mM. Nucleosides and other compounds studied produce only a modest decrease of enzyme activity at 1 mM. Our findings suggest that the enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions by the concentrations of magnesium, nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, and nucleoside di- and triphosphates. The nucleotide pool concentration regulates the enzyme possibly by a mechanism of heterogeneous metabolic pool inhibition. These properties of human placental cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase may be related to the control of nucleotide degradation in vivo.},
