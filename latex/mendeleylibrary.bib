abstract = {Contamination is a well-known but often neglected problem in molecular biology. Here, we investigated the prevalence of cross-contamination among 446 samples from 116 distinct species of animals, which were processed in the same laboratory and subjected to subcontracted transcriptome sequencing. Using cytochrome oxidase 1 as a barcode, we identified a minimum of 782 events of between-species contamination, with approximately 80% of our samples being affected. An analysis of laboratory metadata revealed a strong effect of the sequencing center: nearly all the detected events of between-species contamination involved species that were sent the same day to the same company. We introduce new methods to address the amount of within-species, between-individual contamination, and to correct for this problem when calling genotypes from base read counts. We report evidence for pervasive within-species contamination in this data set, and show that classical population genomic statistics, such as synonymous diversity, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, inbreeding coefficient FIT, and Tajima's D, are sensitive to this problem to various extents. Control analyses suggest that our published results are probably robust to the problem of contamination. Recommendations on how to prevent or avoid contamination in large-scale population genomics/molecular ecology are provided based on this analysis.},

abstract = {During routine screens of the NCBI databases using human repetitive elements we discovered an unlikely level of nucleotide identity across a broad range of phyla. To ascertain whether databases containing DNA sequences, genome assemblies and trace archive reads were contaminated with human sequences, we performed an in depth search for sequences of human origin in non-human species. Using a primate specific SINE, AluY, we screened 2,749 non-primate public databases from NCBI, Ensembl, JGI, and UCSC and have found 492 to be contaminated with human sequence. These represent species ranging from bacteria (B. cereus) to plants (Z. mays) to fish (D. rerio) with examples found from most phyla. The identification of such extensive contamination of human sequence across databases and sequence types warrants caution among the sequencing community in future sequencing efforts, such as human re-sequencing. We discuss issues this may raise as well as present data that gives insight as to how this may be occurring.},

We provided the first chemical case using cellular thermal shift assay to explain the difference between in vitro and cellular activity; MS7 showed best in vitro activity (IC50 = 0.93 ± 0.29 nM) but worst cellular activity due to poor target engagement in living cells. Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified important residues for NAMPT catalytic activity and inhibitor binding.

abstract = {Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a rate-limiting enzyme in regenerating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) from nicotinamide in mammals. NAMPT has crucial roles for many cellular functions by regulating NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase. However, roles of NAMPT in cancer are poorly defined. In this study, we show that NAMPT is prominently overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells along with SIRT1. Elevation of NAMPT expression occurs early for the prostate neoplasia. Inhibition of NAMPT significantly suppresses cell growth in culture, soft agar colony formation, cell invasion and growth of xenografted prostate cancer cells in mice. NAMPT knockdown sensitizes prostate cancer cells to oxidative stress caused by H(2)O(2) or chemotherapeutic treatment. Overexpression of NAMPT increases prostate cancer cell resistance to oxidative stress, which is partially blocked by SIRT1 knockdown. We demonstrate that in addition to modulating SIRT1 functions, the NAMPT inhibition reduces forkhead box, class 'O' (FOXO)3a protein expression and its downstream anti-oxidant genes catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase. Our results suggest important roles of concomitant upregulation of NAMPT and SIRT1 along with increased FOXO3a protein level for prostate carcinogenesis and their contribution to oxidative stress resistance of prostate cancer cells. These findings may have implications for exploring the NAMPT pathway for prostate cancer prevention and treatment.},

The expression of Nampt and its role in gastric cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, using real-time PCR and Western blotting we found that Nampt was overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in established gastric cancer cells and human gastric cancer tissues. The specific Nampt inhibitor FK866 repressed gastric cancer cell proliferation, as assessed by MTT assay. Using transwell and soft agar clonogenic assays, we also found that FK866 suppressed gastric cancer cell migration and anchorage-independent growth, respectively. These inhibitory effects of FK866 were accompanied by significantly decreased expression of VEGF, MMP2, MMP9 and NF-$\kappa$B. As determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry, FK866 also increased the chemo-sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to fluorouracil by greater inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis.

Here we develop a novel inference scheme for mutational landscapes, which is based on the statistical analysis of large alignments of homologs of the protein of interest. Our method is able to capture epistatic couplings between residues, and therefore to assess the dependence of mutational effects on the sequence context where they appear. Compared to recent large-scale mutagenesis data of the beta-lactamase TEM-1, a protein providing resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics, our method leads to an increase of about 40% in explicative power as compared to approaches neglecting epistasis. We find that the informative sequence context extends to residues at native distances of about 20{\AA} from the mutated site, reaching thus far beyond residues in direct physical contact.},

abstract = {Members of the family Pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an NAD supplement for growth on laboratory media. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadV, whose presence allows NAD-independent growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. This gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for NAD independence in Haemophilus ducreyi. When transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed NAD-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of NAD on defined media. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 55,619 Da. Compared with the sequence databases, NadV was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor PBEF and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Synechocystis sp., Deinococcus radiodurans, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. P. multocida and A. actinomycetemcomitans are among the NAD-independent members of the Pasteurellaceae. Homologues of NadV were not found in the sequenced genome of H. influenzae, an NAD-dependent member of the Pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of NAD, such as Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. Identification of a function for this gene in the Pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.},

Here we investigate avian phylogeny with an unprecedented scale of data: >390,000 bases of genomic sequence data from each of 198 species of living birds, representing all major avian lineages, and two crocodilian outgroups. Sequence data were collected using anchored hybrid enrichment, yielding 259 nuclear loci with an average length of 1,523 bases for a total data set of over 7.8 × 107 bases. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses yielded highly supported and nearly identical phylogenetic trees for all major avian lineages. Five major clades form successive sister groups to the rest of Neoaves: (1) a clade including nightjars, other caprimulgiforms, swifts, and hummingbirds; (2) a clade uniting cuckoos, bustards, and turacos with pigeons, mesites, and sandgrouse; (3) cranes and their relatives; (4) a comprehensive waterbird clade, including all diving, wading, and shorebirds; and (5) a comprehensive landbird clade with the enigmatic hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) as the sister group to the rest. Neither of the two main, recently proposed Neoavian clades—Columbea and Passerea—were supported as monophyletic. The results of our divergence time analyses are congruent with the palaeontological record, supporting a major radiation of crown birds in the wake of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene (K–Pg) mass extinction.},

Main sources of intracellular NAD are the salvage pathways from nicotinamide, where Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferases (NAMPTs) and Nicotinamidases (PNCs) have a key role. NAMPTs and PNCs are important in aging, infection and disease conditions such as diabetes and cancer. These enzymes have been considered redundant since either one or the other exists in each individual genome. The co-occurrence of NAMPT and PNC was only recently detected in invertebrates though no structural or functional characterization exists for them. Here, using expression and evolutionary analysis combined with homology modeling and protein-ligand docking, we show that both genes are expressed simultaneously in key species of major invertebrate branches and emphasize sequence and structural conservation patterns in metazoan NAMPT and PNC homologues. The results anticipate that NAMPTs and PNCs are simultaneously active, raising the possibility that NAD salvage pathways are not redundant as both are maintained to fulfill the requirement for NAD production in some species.},

abstract = {NAD is essential for cellular metabolism and has also a key role in various signaling pathways in human cells. To ensure proper control of vital reactions, NAD must be permanently resynthesized. Nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinic acid (NA) as well as nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinic acid riboside (NAR) are the major precursors for NAD biosynthesis in humans. In this study we explored whether the ribosides NR and NAR can be generated in human cells. We demonstrate that purified, recombinant human cytosolic 5'-nucleotidases (5'-NTs) CN-II and CN-III, but not CN-IA, can dephosphorylate the mononucleotides NMN and NAMN and thus catalyze NR and NAR formation in vitro. Similar to their counterpart from yeast, Sdt1, the human 5'-NTs require high (millimolar) concentrations of NMN or NAMN for efficient catalysis. Overexpression of FLAG-tagged CN-II and CN-III in HEK293 and HepG2 cells resulted in the formation and release of NAR. However, NAR accumulation in the culture medium of these cells was only detectable under conditions that led to increased NAMN production from NA. The amount of NAR released from cells engineered for increased NAMN production was sufficient to maintain viability of surrounding cells unable to use any other NAD precursor. Moreover, we found that untransfected HeLa cells produce and release sufficient amounts of NAR and NR under normal culture conditions. Collectively, our results indicate that cytosolic 5'-NTs participate in the conversion of NAD precursors and establish NR and NAR as integral constituents of human NAD metabolism. In addition, they point to the possibility that different cell types might facilitate each other's NAD supply by providing alternative precursors.},

abstract = {Nicotinamide 1-beta-D-riboside (Nir), the cationic, reducible moiety of the coenzyme NAD+, has been confirmed as an unusual substrate for purified purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from a mammalian source (calf spleen). It is also a substrate of the enzyme from Escherichia coli. The Km values at pH 7, 1.48 mM and 0.62 mM, respectively, were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than for the natural substrate inosine, but the Vmax values were comparable, 96% and 35% that for Ino. The pseudo first-order rate constants, Vmax/Km, were 1.1% and 2.5% for the calf spleen and E. coli enzymes. The aglycon, nicotinamide, was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of PNP. Nir was a weak inhibitor of inosine phosphorolysis catalyzed by both enzymes, with Ki values close to the Km for its phosphorolysis, consistent with simple competitive inhibition; this was further confirmed by Dixon plots. Phosphorolysis of the fluorescent positively charged substrate 7-methylguanosine was also inhibited in a competitive manner by both Ino and Nir. Phosphorolysis of Nir by both enzymes was inhibited competitively by several specific inhibitors of calf spleen and E. coli PNP, with Ki values similar to those for inhibition of other natural substrates. The pH dependence of the kinetic constants for the phosphorolysis of Nir and of a variety of other substrates, was extensively investigated, particularly in the alkaline pH range, where Nir exhibited abnormally high substrate activity relative to the reduced reaction rates of both enzymes towards other anionic or neutral substrates. The overall results are discussed in relation to present concepts regarding binding and phosphorolysis of substrates by PNP based on crystallographic data of enzyme-inhibitor complexes, and current studies on enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms of the cleavage of the Nir glycosidic bond.},

Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational "experiments" that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation and dietary deficiencies.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to provide further information about the relevance of raised urinary levels of N-methylnicotinamide (NMN), and/or its metabolites N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY) and N-methyl-2-pyridone-3-carboxamide (2PY), to peroxisome proliferation by dosing rats with known peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligands [fenofibrate, diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFA)] and other compounds believed to modulate lipid metabolism via PPARalpha-independent mechanisms (simvastatin, hydrazine and chlorpromazine). Urinary NMN was correlated with standard markers of peroxisome proliferation and serum lipid parameters with the aim of establishing whether urinary NMN could be used as a biomarker for peroxisome proliferation in the rat. Data from this study were also used to validate a previously constructed multivariate statistical model of peroxisome proliferation (PP) in the rat. The predictive model, based on 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of urine, uses spectral patterns of NMN, 4PY and other endogenous metabolites to predict hepatocellular peroxisome count. Each treatment induced pharmacological (serum lipid) effects characteristic of their class, but only fenofibrate, DEHP and simvastatin increased peroxisome number and raised urinary NMN, 2PY and 4PY, with simvastatin having only a transient effect on the latter. These compounds also reduced mRNA expression for aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSDase, EC 4.1.1.45), the enzyme believed to be involved in modulating the flux of tryptophan through this pathway, with decreasing order of potency, fenofibrate (-10.39-fold) >DEHP (-3.09-fold) >simvastatin (-1.84-fold). Of the other treatments, only LCFA influenced mRNA expression of ACMSDase (-3.62-fold reduction) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRTase, EC 2.4.2.19) (-2.42-fold) without any change in urinary NMN excretion. Although there were no correlations between urinary NMN concentration and serum lipid parameters, NMN did correlate with peroxisome count (r2=0.63) and acyl-CoA oxidase activity (r2=0.61). These correlations were biased by the large response to fenofibrate compared to the other treatments; nevertheless the data do indicate a relationship between the tryptophan-NAD+ pathway and PPARalpha-dependent pathways, making this metabolite a potentially useful biomarker to detect PP. In order to strengthen the observed link between the metabolites associated with the tryptophan-NAD+ pathway and more accurately predict PP, other urinary metabolites were included in a predictive statistical model. This statistical model was found to predict the observed PP in 26/27 instances using a pre-determined threshold of 2-fold mean control peroxisome count. The model also predicted a time-dependent increase in peroxisome count for the fenofibrate group, which is important when considering the use of such modelling to predict the onset and progression of PP prior to its observation in samples taken at autopsy.},

On the other hand, noncachexigenic subclone (clone 5)-transplanted mice showed neither increase of NNMT activity nor carcass weight loss. Among cytostatic fluorinated pyrimidines, 5'-dFUrd could inhibit the increase of NNMT activity and prevent weight loss in mice bearing clone 20. On the other hand, 2'-dFUrd did not show these effects. 5-FUra and Tegafur inhibited the increase of NNMT activity at higher concentrations. These findings suggest that the levels of hepatic NNMT activity are closely associated with the degree of weight loss, and they appear to be a useful marker of cancer cachexia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nicotinamide methylation followed by urinary excretion of N-methylnicotinamide increases in cirrhotic patients, despite the derangement of the overall methylation processes in liver disease. The rise in N-methylnicotinamide could depend, at least in part, on a reduced transformation of this molecule into 2-pyridone-5-carboxamide. The aim of this study was to investigate this hypothesis. METHODS: Serum and urinary levels (mean ±SEM) of N-methylnicotinamide and urinary excretion of 2-pyridone-5-carboxamide were measured in 10 healthy controls and 10 patients with liver cirrhosis in basal conditions and after a nicotinamide oral load (1.5 mg/kg body weight). RESULTS: N-methylnicotinamide serum levels increased significantly (p <0.01) in cirrhotic patients compared to controls, both as basal values (0.43 ±0.07 nmol/ml;0.15 ±0.01) and as area under the curve 5 h after a nicotinamide load (cirrhotics: 562.4 ±50.5 nmol/ml {\textperiodcentered} min; controls: 314.4 ±23.8). Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of N-methylnicotinamide and 2-pyridone-5-carboxamide was also significantly (p <0.05) increased in cirrhotic patients versus controls, both in basal conditions (N-methylnicotinamide: 82.0 ±8.4 $\mu$mol, 48.8 ±4.8;2-pyridone-5-carboxamide: 129.3 ±23.0, 64.6 ±9.8) and after a nicotinamide oral load (N-methylnicotinamide: 290.1 ±23.1, 180.8 ±7.4; 2-pyridone-5-carboxamide: 694.7 ±32.5, 391.0 ±21.9). Moreover, 24 h N-methylnicotinamide/2-pyridone-5-carboxamide ratio was similar in patients and controls (basal: 0.78 ±0.39, 0.90 ±0.51;load: 0.42 ±0.11, 0.48 ±0.16). CONCLUSIONS: In cirrhotic patients nicotinamide methylation is increased, as shown by the rise in urinary N-methylnicotinamide and 2-pyridone-5-carboxamide that is concurrent and proportional (constant 24-h metabolite ratio). The hyperfunction of this methylating pathway might play a protective role against the toxic effect of intracellular accumulation of nicotinamide deriving from the catabolic state of cirrhosis. {\textcopyright}2001 by Am.

abstract = {The redox cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays a central role in metabolism and is a substrate for signaling enzymes including poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins. NAD concentration falls during aging, which has triggered intense interest in strategies to boost NAD levels. A limitation in understanding NAD metabolism has been reliance on concentration measurements. Here, we present isotope-tracer methods for NAD flux quantitation. In cell lines, NAD was made from nicotinamide and consumed largely by PARPs and sirtuins. In vivo, NAD was made from tryptophan selectively in the liver, which then excreted nicotinamide. NAD fluxes varied widely across tissues, with high flux in the small intestine and spleen and low flux in the skeletal muscle. Intravenous administration of nicotinamide riboside or mononucleotide delivered intact molecules to multiple tissues, but the same agents given orally were metabolized to nicotinamide in the liver. Thus, flux analysis can reveal tissue-specific NAD metabolism. Tissue concentrations of the redox cofactor NAD change during aging and disease. Liu et al. developed isotope-tracer methods to quantitate NAD fluxes in cell culture and in mice, revealing that the liver makes nicotinamide from tryptophan and from orally delivered nicotinamide riboside, a nutraceutical. In contrast, other tissues rely on circulating nicotinamide for NAD synthesis.},

abstract = {Interest in the modulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolome is gaining great momentum because of its therapeutic potential in different human disorders. Suppression of nicotinamide salvage by nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) inhibitors, however, gave inconclusive results in neoplastic patients because several metabolic routes circumvent the enzymatic block converging directly on nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) for NAD synthesis. Unfortunately, NMNAT inhibitors have not been identified. Here, we report the identification of Vacor as a substrate metabolized by the consecutive action of NAMPT and NMNAT2 into the NAD analog Vacor adenine dinucleotide (VAD). This leads to inhibition of both enzymes, as well as NAD-dependent dehydrogenases, thereby causing unprecedented rapid NAD depletion, glycolytic block, energy failure, and necrotic death of NMNAT2-proficient cancer cells. Conversely, lack of NMNAT2 expression confers complete resistance to Vacor. Remarkably, Vacor prompts VAD formation and growth suppression in NMNAT2-positive neuroblastoma and melanoma xenografts. Our data show the first evidence of harnessing the entire nicotinamide salvage pathway for antimetabolic strategies.},

abstract = {The cell cycle-dependent nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins is predominantly regulated by CDK kinase activities; however, it is currently difficult to predict the proteins thus regulated, largely because of the low prediction efficiency of the motifs involved. Here, we report the successful prediction of CDK1-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins using a prediction system for nuclear localization signals (NLSs). By systematic amino acid replacement analyses in budding yeast, we created activity-based profiles for different classes of importin-alpha-dependent NLSs that represent the functional contributions of different amino acids at each position within an NLS class. We then developed a computer program for prediction of the classical importin-alpha/beta pathway-specific NLSs (cNLS Mapper, available at http//nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/) that calculates NLS activities by using these profiles and an additivity-based motif scoring algorithm. This calculation method achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and specificity than did current methods. The search for NLSs that overlap the consensus CDK1 phosphorylation site by using cNLS Mapper identified all previously reported and 5 previously uncharacterized yeast proteins (Yen1, Psy4, Pds1, Msa1, and Dna2) displaying CDK1- and cell cycle-regulated nuclear transport. CDK1 activated or repressed their nuclear import activity, depending on the position of CDK1-phosphorylation sites within NLSs. The application of this strategy to other functional linear motifs should be useful in systematic studies of protein-protein networks.},

abstract = {Methylation is one of the most common chemical modifications of biologically active molecules and it occurs in all life forms. Its functional role is very diverse and involves many essential cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcriptional control, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Here, we provide further insight into the enzymatic methylation in S. cerevisiae by conducting a comprehensive structural and functional survey of all the methyltransferases encoded in its genome. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition, we found that the S. cerevisiae methyltransferome comprises 86 MTases (53 well-known and 33 putative with unknown substrate specificity). Structural classification of their catalytic domains shows that these enzymes may adopt nine different folds, the most common being the Rossmann-like. We also analyzed the domain architecture of these proteins and identified several new domain contexts. Interestingly, we found that the majority of MTase genes are periodically expressed during yeast metabolic cycle. This finding, together with calculated isoelectric point, fold assignment and cellular localization, was used to develop a novel approach for predicting substrate specificity. Using this approach, we predicted the general substrates for 24 of 33 putative MTases and confirmed these predictions experimentally in both cases tested. Finally, we show that, in S. cerevisiae, methylation is carried out by 34 RNA MTases, 32 protein MTases, eight small molecule MTases, three lipid MTases, and nine MTases with still unknown substrate specificity.},

In contrast with recent observations, here we find that overexpression of sir-2.1, the ortholog of mammalian SirT1, does extend Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Sirtuins mandatorily convert NAD(+) into nicotinamide (NAM). We here find that NAM and its metabolite, 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA), extend C. elegans lifespan, even in the absence of sir-2.1. We identify a previously unknown C. elegans nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase, encoded by a gene now named anmt-1, to generate MNA from NAM. Disruption and overexpression of anmt-1 have opposing effects on lifespan independent of sirtuins, with loss of anmt-1 fully inhibiting sir-2.1-mediated lifespan extension. MNA serves as a substrate for a newly identified aldehyde oxidase, GAD-3, to generate hydrogen peroxide, which acts as a mitohormetic reactive oxygen species signal to promote C. elegans longevity. Taken together, sirtuin-mediated lifespan extension depends on methylation of NAM, providing an unexpected mechanistic role for sirtuins beyond histone deacetylation.},

abstract = {In obesity and type 2 diabetes, Glut4 glucose transporter expression is decreased selectively in adipocytes. Adipose-specific knockout or overexpression of Glut4 alters systemic insulin sensitivity. Here we show, using DNA array analyses, that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) is the most strongly reciprocally regulated gene when comparing gene expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) from adipose-specific Glut4-knockout or adipose-specific Glut4-overexpressing mice with their respective controls. NNMT methylates nicotinamide (vitamin B3) using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. Nicotinamide is a precursor of NAD(+), an important cofactor linking cellular redox states with energy metabolism. SAM provides propylamine for polyamine biosynthesis and donates a methyl group for histone methylation. Polyamine flux including synthesis, catabolism and excretion, is controlled by the rate-limiting enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and spermidine-spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT; encoded by Sat1) and by polyamine oxidase (PAO), and has a major role in energy metabolism. We report that NNMT expression is increased in WAT and liver of obese and diabetic mice. Nnmt knockdown in WAT and liver protects against diet-induced obesity by augmenting cellular energy expenditure. NNMT inhibition increases adipose SAM and NAD(+) levels and upregulates ODC and SSAT activity as well as expression, owing to the effects of NNMT on histone H3 lysine 4 methylation in adipose tissue. Direct evidence for increased polyamine flux resulting from NNMT inhibition includes elevated urinary excretion and adipocyte secretion of diacetylspermine, a product of polyamine metabolism. NNMT inhibition in adipocytes increases oxygen consumption in an ODC-, SSAT- and PAO-dependent manner. Thus, NNMT is a novel regulator of histone methylation, polyamine flux and NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 signalling, and is a unique and attractive target for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation. AVAILABILITY The complete software is available in binary (executable) for MS Windows, OS X, Linux (Intel) and Sun Solaris (SPARC), as well as the full source code under an open source license from http://www.copasi.org.},

abstract = {Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) methylates nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, to produce N(1)-methylnicotinamide (MNAM). Nnmt has emerged as a metabolic regulator in adipocytes, but its role in the liver, the tissue with the strongest Nnmt expression, is not known. In spite of its overall high expression, here we find that hepatic expression of Nnmt is highly variable and correlates with multiple metabolic parameters in mice and humans. Further, we find that suppression of hepatic Nnmt expression in vivo alters glucose and cholesterol metabolism and that the metabolic effects of Nnmt in the liver are mediated by its product MNAM. Supplementation of high-fat diet with MNAM decreases serum and liver cholesterol and liver triglycerides levels in mice. Mechanistically, increasing Nnmt expression or MNAM levels stabilizes sirtuin 1 protein, an effect that is required for their metabolic benefits. In summary, we describe here a novel regulatory pathway for vitamin B3 that could provide a new opportunity for metabolic disease therapy.},

abstract = {The Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) family of enzymes consists of NAD(+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylases that tightly couple the hydrolysis of NAD(+) and the deacetylation of an acetylated substrate to form nicotinamide, the deacetylated product, and the novel metabolite O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPR). In this paper, we analyzed the substrate specificity of the yeast Sir2 (ySir2), the yeast HST2, and the human SIRT2 homologues toward various monoacetylated histone H3 and H4 peptides, determined the basic kinetic mechanism, and resolved individual chemical steps of the Sir2 reaction. Using steady-state kinetic analysis, we have shown that ySir2, HST2, and SIRT2 exhibit varying catalytic efficiencies and display a preference among the monoacetylated peptide substrates. Bisubstrate kinetic analysis indicates that Sir2 enzymes follow a sequential mechanism, where both the acetylated substrate and NAD(+) must bind to form a ternary complex, prior to any catalytic step. Using rapid-kinetic analysis, we have shown that after ternary complex formation, nicotinamide cleavage occurs first, followed by the transfer of the acetyl group from the donor substrate to the ADP-ribose portion of NAD(+) to form OAADPr and the deacetylated product. Product and dead-end inhibition analyses revealed that nicotinamide is the first product released followed by random release of OAADPr and the deacetylated product.},

abstract = {Human nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT, EC 2.4.2.12) catalyzes the reversible synthesis of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PP i) from nicotinamide (NAM) and alpha- d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). NAMPT, by capturing the energy provided by its facultative ATPase activity, allows the production of NMN at product:substrate ratios thermodynamically forbidden in the absence of ATP. With ATP hydrolysis coupled to NMN synthesis, the catalytic efficiency of the system is improved 1100-fold, substrate affinity dramatically increases ( K m (NAM) from 855 to 5 nM), and the K eq shifts -2.1 kcal/mol toward NMN formation. ADP-ATP isotopic exchange experiments support the formation of a high-energy phosphorylated intermediate (phospho-H247) as the mechanism for altered catalytic efficiency during ATP hydrolysis. NAMPT captures only a small portion of the energy generated by ATP hydrolysis to shift the dynamic chemical equilibrium. Although the weak energetic coupling of ATP hydrolysis appears to be a nonoptimized enzymatic function, closer analysis of this remarkable protein reveals an enzyme designed to capture NAM with high efficiency at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. NMN is a rate-limiting precursor for recycling to the essential regulatory cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD (+)). NMN synthesis by NAMPT is powerfully inhibited by both NAD (+) ( K i = 0.14 muM) and NADH ( K i = 0.22 muM), an apparent regulatory feedback mechanism.},

The accuracy of the models generated by SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated by the CAMEO system. The new web site allows users to interactively search for templates, cluster them by sequence similarity, structurally compare alternative templates and select the ones to be used for model building. In cases where multiple alternative template structures are available for a protein of interest, a user-guided template selection step allows building models in different functional states.

abstract = {We used sequence motifs conserved in S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases to identify 26 putative methyltransferases from the complete genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Seven sequences with the best matches to the methyltransferase consensus motifs were selected for further study. We prepared yeast disruption mutants of each of the genes encoding these sequences, and we found that disruption of the YJL125c gene is lethal, whereas disruptions of YCR047c and YDR140w lead to slow growth phenotypes. Normal growth was observed when the YDL201w, YDR465c, YHR209w, and YOR240w genes were disrupted. Initial analysis of protein methylation patterns of all mutants by amino acid analysis revealed that the YDR465c mutant has a defect in the methylation of the delta-nitrogen atom of arginine residues. We propose that YDR465c codes for the methyltransferase responsible for this recently characterized type of protein methylation, and we designate the enzyme as Rmt2 (protein arginine methyltransferase). In addition, we show that the methylation of susceptible residues in Rmt2 substrates is likely to take place on nascent polypeptide chains and that these substrates exist in the cell as fully methylated species. Interestingly, Rmt2 has 27% sequence identity over 138 amino acids to the mammalian guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for methylating the delta-nitrogen of the small molecule guanidinoacetate.},

abstract = {Biosynthesis of NAD(P) cofactors is of special importance for cyanobacteria due to their role in photosynthesis and respiration. Despite significant progress in understanding NAD(P) biosynthetic machinery in some model organisms, relatively little is known about its implementation in cyanobacteria. We addressed this problem by a combination of comparative genome analysis with verification experiments in the model system of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. A detailed reconstruction of the NAD(P) metabolic subsystem using the SEED genomic platform (http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/index.cgi) helped us accurately annotate respective genes in the entire set of 13 cyanobacterial species with completely sequenced genomes available at the time. Comparative analysis of operational variants implemented in this divergent group allowed us to elucidate both conserved (de novo and universal pathways) and variable (recycling and salvage pathways) aspects of this subsystem. Focused genetic and biochemical experiments confirmed several conjectures about the key aspects of this subsystem. (i) The product of the slr1691 gene, a homolog of Escherichia coli gene nadE containing an additional nitrilase-like N-terminal domain, is a NAD synthetase capable of utilizing glutamine as an amide donor in vitro. (ii) The product of the sll1916 gene, a homolog of E. coli gene nadD, is a nicotinic acid mononucleotide-preferring adenylyltransferase. This gene is essential for survival and cannot be compensated for by an alternative nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)-preferring adenylyltransferase (slr0787 gene). (iii) The product of the slr0788 gene is a nicotinamide-preferring phosphoribosyltransferase involved in the first step of the two-step non-deamidating utilization of nicotinamide (NMN shunt). (iv) The physiological role of this pathway encoded by a conserved gene cluster, slr0787-slr0788, is likely in the recycling of endogenously generated nicotinamide, as supported by the inability of this organism to utilize exogenously provided niacin. Positional clustering and the co-occurrence profile of the respective genes across a diverse collection of cellular organisms provide evidence of horizontal transfer events in the evolutionary history of this pathway.},

In eukaryotes, nicotinamide riboside is a newly discovered NAD+ precursor that is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide by specific nicotinamide riboside kinases, Nrk1 and Nrk2. In this study, we discovered that exogenous nicotinamide riboside promotes Sir2-dependent repression of recombination, improves gene silencing, and extends lifespan without calorie restriction. The mechanism of action of nicotinamide riboside is totally dependent on increased net NAD+ synthesis through two pathways, the Nrk1 pathway and the Urh1/Pnp1/Meu1 pathway, which is Nrk1 independent. Additionally, the two nicotinamide riboside salvage pathways contribute to NAD+ metabolism in the absence of nicotinamide-riboside supplementation. Thus, like calorie restriction in the mouse, nicotinamide riboside elevates NAD+ and increases Sir2 function. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The coenzyme bioavailability may be significantly affected by these reactions, with ensuing major impact on energy metabolism, cell survival, and aging. Moreover, through the activity of the NAD-dependent deacetylating sirtuins, NAD behaves as a beacon molecule that reports the cell metabolic state, and accordingly modulates transcriptional responses and metabolic adaptations. In this view, NAD biosynthesis emerges as a highly regulated process: it enables cells to preserve NAD homeostasis in response to significant NAD-consuming events and it can be modulated by various stimuli to induce, via NAD level changes, suitable NAD-mediated metabolic responses.

abstract = {Mitochondria play a critical role in energy production, cell signalling and cell survival. Defects in mitochondrial function contribute to the ageing process and ageing-related disorders such as metabolic disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. The sirtuin family of deacylase enzymes have a variety of subcellular localisations and have been found to remove a growing list of post-translational acyl modifications from target proteins. SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are found primarily located in the mitochondria, and are involved in many of the key processes of this organelle. SIRT3 has been the subject of intense research and is primarily a deacetylase thought to function as a mitochondrial fidelity protein, with roles in mitochondrial substrate metabolism, protection against oxidative stress, and cell survival pathways. Less is known about the functional targets of SIRT4, which has deacetylase, ADP-ribosylase, and a newly-described lipoamidase function, although key roles in lipid and glutamine metabolism have been reported. SIRT5 modulates a host of newly-discovered acyl modifications including succinylation, malonylation, and glutarylation in both mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial compartments, however the functional significance of SIRT5 in the regulation of many of its proposed target proteins remains to be discovered. Because of their influence on a broad range of pathways, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are implicated in a range of disease-states including metabolic disease such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and ageing-related disorders such as hearing-loss and cardiac dysfunction. We review the current knowledge on the function of the three mitochondrial sirtuins, their role in disease, and the current outstanding questions in the field.},

abstract = {Deregulation of apoptosis, the physiological form of cell death, is closely associated with immunological diseases and cancer. Apoptosis is activated either by death receptor-driven or mitochondrial pathways, both of which may provide potential targets for novel anticancer drugs. Although several ligands stimulating death receptors have been described, the actual molecular events triggering the mitochondrial pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show initiation of apoptosis by gradual depletion of the intracellular coenzyme NAD+. We identified the first low molecular weight compound, designated FK866, which induces apoptosis by highly specific, noncompetitive inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a key enzyme in the regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis from the natural precursor nicotinamide. Interference with this enzyme does not primarily intoxicate cells because the mitochondrial respiratory activity and the NAD+ -dependent redox reactions involved remain unaffected as long as NAD+ is not effectively depleted by catabolic reactions. Certain tissues, however, have a high turnover of NAD+ through its cleavage by enzymes like poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Such cells often rely on the more readily available nicotinamide pathway for NAD+ synthesis and undergo apoptosis after inhibition of NAPRT, whereas cells effectively using the nicotinic acid pathway for NAD+ synthesis remain unaffected. In support of this concept, FK866 effectively induced delayed cell death by apoptosis in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells with an IC(50) of approximately 1 nM, did not directly inhibit mitochondrial respiratory activity, but caused gradual NAD+ depletion through specific inhibition of NAPRT. This enzyme, when partially purified from K562 human leukemia cells, was noncompetitively inhibited by FK866, and the inhibitor constants were calculated to be 0.4 nM for the enzyme/substrate complex (K(i)) and 0.3 nM for the free enzyme (K(i)'), respectively. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were both found to have antidote potential for the cellular effects of FK866. FK866 may be used for treatment of diseases implicating deregulated apoptosis such as cancer for immunosuppression or as a sensitizer for genotoxic agents. Furthermore, it may provide an important tool for investigation of the molecular triggers of the mitochondrial pathway leading to apoptosis through enabling temporal separation of NAD+ decrease from ATP breakdown and apoptosis by several days.},

Human liver NNMT activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation which raises the possibility that this enzyme activity might be regulated by a genetic polymorphism, a polymorphism that could have functional implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity. As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, we set out to clone and express a cDNA for human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT was partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, subjected to limited proteolysis, and partial amino acid sequence information was obtained. The polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify a 550-nucleotide sequence with human liver cDNA as template and primers designed on the basis of the NNMT amino acid sequence. The 5'- and 3'-ends of a human liver NNMT cDNA were obtained by use of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The combined use of these approaches resulted in the isolation of a human liver NNMT cDNA that was 969 nucleotides in length, with a 792-nucleotide open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The human liver NNMT cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated with a reticulocyte lysate system to yield a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa that comigrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with photoaffinity-labeled human liver NNMT. The NNMT cDNA was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B). COS-1 cells transfected with this construct expressed a high level of NNMT enzymatic activity, and the biochemical properties of this activity were similar to those of human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT and transfected COS-1 cell NNMT had apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction, nicotinamide and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, of 0.43 and 0.38 mM and of 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. IC50 values for the inhibition of NNMT by N1-methylnicotinamide were 60 and 30 microns for human liver and COS-1 cell-expressed NNMT, respectively. Cloning of a cDNA for human liver NNMT will help make it possible to test the hypothesis that inheritance may play a role in the regulation of individual differences in human liver NNMT activity.},

Supplementing these NAD+intermediates has shown preventive and therapeutic effects, ameliorating age-associated pathophysiologies and disease conditions. Although the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fates of NMN and NR are still under intensive investigation, these NAD+intermediates can exhibit distinct behavior, and their fates appear to depend on the tissue distribution and expression levels of NAD+biosynthetic enzymes, nucleotidases, and presumptive transporters for each. A comprehensive concept that connects NAD+metabolism to the control of aging and longevity in mammals has been proposed, and the stage is now set to test whether these exciting preclinical results can be translated to improve human health. NAD+is increasingly being recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of age-associated functional decline and diseases.

abstract = {A key process in the regulation of protein activities and thus cellular signaling pathways is the modification of proteins by post-translational mechanisms. Knowledge about the enzymes (writers and erasers) that attach and remove post-translational modifications, the targets that are modified and the functional consequences elicited by specific modifications, is crucial for understanding cell biological processes. Moreover detailed knowledge about these mechanisms and pathways helps to elucidate the molecular causes of various diseases and in defining potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation refers to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent modification of proteins with ADP-ribose and is catalyzed by enzymes of the ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin like, also known as PARP) family as well as some members of the Sirtuin family. Poly-ADP-ribosylation is relatively well understood with inhibitors being used as anti-cancer agents. However, the majority of ARTD enzymes and the ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins are restricted to catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation. Although writers, readers and erasers of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation have been identified only recently, it is becoming more and more evident that this reversible post-translational modification is capable of modulating key intracellular processes and signaling pathways. These include signal transduction mechanisms, stress pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules, and chromatin-associated processes such as transcription and DNA repair. We hypothesize that mono-ADP-ribosylation controls, through these different pathways, the development of cancer and infectious diseases.},

The considerable recent progress in the science of PARP in the last decade and the discovery of a PARP superfamily (17 members) has introduced this modification as a key mechanism regulating a wide variety of cellular processes including among others transcription, regulation of chromatin dynamics, telomere homeostasis, differentiation and cell death. However, the most extensive studied and probably the best characterized role is in DNA repair where it plays pivotal roles in the processing and resolution of the damaged DNA. Although much of the focus has been on PARP1 in DNA repair, recent advances highlight the emergence of other DNA-dependent PARPs (i.e. PARP2, PARP3 and possibly Tankyrase) in this process. Here we will summarize the recent insights into the molecular functions of these PARPs in different DNA repair pathways in which they emerge as specific actors. Furthermore, the DNA repair functions of PARP1 have stimulated another area of intense research in the field with the development of potent and selective PARP1 inhibitors to promote genome instability and cell death in tumor cells. Their current use in clinical trials have demonstrated potentiation of antitumoral drugs and cytotoxicity in repair deficient tumor cells. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, over the past 20 years, NAD(+) has been shown to be a key signaling molecule that mediates post-translational protein modifications and serves as precursor of ADP-ribose-containing messenger molecules, which are involved in calcium mobilization. In contrast to its role as a redox carrier, NAD(+)-dependent signaling processes involve the release of nicotinamide (Nam) and require constant replenishment of cellular NAD(+) pools. So far, very little is known about the evolution of NAD(P) synthesis in eukaryotes. In the present study, genes involved in NAD(P) metabolism in 45 species were identified and analyzed with regard to similarities and differences in NAD(P) synthesis. The results show that the Preiss-Handler pathway and NAD(+) kinase are present in all organisms investigated, and thus seem to be ancestral routes. Additionally, two pathways exist that convert Nam to NAD(+); we identified several species that have apparently functional copies of both biosynthetic routes, which have been thought to be mutually exclusive. Furthermore, our findings suggest the parallel phylogenetic appearance of Nam N-methyltransferase, Nam phosphoribosyl transferase, and poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases.},

abstract = {NAD, as well as its phosphorylated form, NADP, are best known as electron carriers and co-substrates of various redox reactions. As such they participate in approximately one quarter of all reactions listed in the reaction database KEGG. In metabolic pathway analysis, the total amount of NAD is usually assumed to be constant. That means that changes in the redox state might be considered, but concentration changes of the NAD moiety are usually neglected. However, a growing number of NAD-consuming reactions have been identified, showing that this assumption does not hold true in general. NAD-consuming reactions are common characteristics of NAD(+)-dependent signalling pathways and include mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation of proteins, NAD(+)-dependent deacetylation by sirtuins and the formation of messenger molecules such as cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid (NA)-ADP (NAADP). NAD-consuming reactions are thus involved in major signalling and gene regulation pathways such as DNA-repair or regulation of enzymes central in metabolism. All known NAD(+)-dependent signalling processes include the release of nicotinamide (Nam). Thus cellular NAD pools need to be constantly replenished, mostly by recycling Nam to NAD(+). This process is, among others, regulated by the circadian clock, causing complex dynamic changes in NAD concentration. As disturbances in NAD homoeostasis are associated with a large number of diseases ranging from cancer to diabetes, it is important to better understand the dynamics of NAD metabolism to develop efficient pharmacological invention strategies to target this pathway.},

Because NAD is also an essential redox carrier, its continuous resynthesis is vital. In higher eukaryotes, maintenance of compartmentalized NAD pools is critical, but so far rather little is known about the regulation and subcellular distribution of NAD biosynthetic enzymes. The key step in NAD biosynthesis is the formation of the dinucleotide by nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). The three human isoforms were localized to the nucleus, the Golgi complex, and mitochondria. Here, we show that their genes contain unique exons that encode isoform-specific domains to mediate subcellular targeting and post-translational modifications. These domains are dispensable for catalytic activity, consistent with their absence from NMNATs of lower organisms. We further demonstrate that the Golgi-associated NMNAT is palmitoylated at two adjacent cysteine residues of its isoform-specific domain and thereby anchored at the cytoplasmic surface, a potential mechanism to regulate the cytosolic NAD pool. Insertion of unique domains thus provides a yet unrecognized enzyme targeting mode, which has also been adapted to modulate subcellular NAD supply.},

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including decreased oxidative damage and altered energy metabolism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lifespan extension by calorie restriction requires the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, Sir2 (ref. 1). We have recently shown that Sir2 and its closest human homologue SIRT1, a p53 deacetylase, are strongly inhibited by the vitamin B3 precursor nicotinamide2. Here we show that increased expression of PNC1 (pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase 1), which encodes an enzyme that deaminates nicotinamide, is both necessary and sufficient for lifespan extension by calorie restriction and low-intensity stress. We also identify PNC1 as a longevity gene that is responsive to all stimuli that extend lifespan. We provide evidence that nicotinamide depletion is sufficient to activate Sir2 and that this is the mechanism by which PNC1 regulates longevity. We conclude that yeast lifespan extension by calorie restriction is the consequence of an active cellular response to a low-intensity stress and speculate that nicotinamide might regulate critical cellular processes in higher organisms.},

ATP-phosphorylation of an active-site histidine causes catalytic activation, increasing NAM affinity by 160,000. Crystal structures of NAMPT with catalytic site ligands identify the phosphorylation site, establish its role in catalysis, demonstrate unique overlapping ATP and phosphoribosyltransferase sites, and establish reaction coordinate motion. NAMPT structures with beryllium fluoride indicate a covalent H247-BeF(3)(-) as the phosphohistidine mimic. Activation of NAMPT by H247-phosphorylation causes stabilization of the enzyme-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate complex, permitting efficient capture of NAM. Reactant and product structures establish reaction coordinate motion for NAMPT to be migration of the ribosyl anomeric carbon from the pyrophosphate leaving group to the nicotinamide-N1 while the 5-phosphoryl group, the pyrophosphate moiety, and the nicotinamide ring remain fixed in the catalytic site.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is an essential, highly methylated protein that facilitates translational elongation by delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs to ribosomes. Here, we report a new eukaryotic protein N-terminal methyltransferase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae YLR285W, which methylates eEF1A at a previously undescribed high-stoichiometry N-terminal site and the adjacent lysine. Deletion of YLR285W resulted in the loss of N-terminal and lysine methylation in vivo, whereas overexpression of YLR285W resulted in an increase of methylation at these sites. This was confirmed by in vitro methylation of eEF1A by recombinant YLR285W. Accordingly, we name YLR285W as elongation factor methyltransferase 7 (Efm7). This enzyme is a new type of eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferase as, unlike the three other known eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferases, its substrate does not have an N-terminal [A/P/S]-P-K motif. We show that the N-terminal methylation of eEF1A is also present in human; this conservation over a large evolutionary distance suggests it to be of functional importance. This study also reports that the trimethylation of Lys79 in eEF1A is conserved from yeast to human. The methyltransferase responsible for Lys79 methylation of human eEF1A is shown to be N6AMT2, previously documented as a putative N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase. It is the direct ortholog of the recently described yeast Efm5, and we show that Efm5 and N6AMT2 can methylate eEF1A from either species in vitro. We therefore rename N6AMT2 as eEF1A-KMT1. Including the present work, yeast eEF1A is now documented to be methylated by five different methyltransferases, making it one of the few eukaryotic proteins to be extensively methylated by independent enzymes. This implies more extensive regulation of eEF1A by this posttranslational modification than previously appreciated.},

@article{Gossmann2014DNAR,
abstract = {Highlights: NAD is not only an important cofactor in redox reactions but has also received attention in recent years because of its physiological importance in metabolic regulation, DNA repair and signaling. In contrast to the redox reactions, these regulatory processes involve degradation of NAD and therefore necessitate a constant replenishment of its cellular pool. NAD biosynthetic enzymes are common to almost all species in all clades, but the number of NAD degrading enzymes varies substantially across taxa. In particular, vertebrates, including humans, have a manifold of NAD degrading enzymes which require a high turnover of NAD. As there is currently a lack of a systematic study of how natural selection has shaped enzymes involved in NAD metabolism we conducted a comprehensive evolutionary analysis based on intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence. We compare NAD biosynthetic and degrading enzymes in four eukaryotic model species and subsequently focus on human NAD metabolic enzymes and their orthologs in other vertebrates. We find that the majority of enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are subject to varying levels of purifying selection. While NAD biosynthetic enzymes appear to experience a rather high level of evolutionary constraint, there is evidence for positive selection among enzymes mediating NAD-dependent signaling. This is particularly evident for members of the PARP family, a diverse protein family involved in DNA damage repair and programmed cell death. Based on haplotype information and substitution rate analysis we pinpoint sites that are potential targets of positive selection. We also link our findings to a three dimensional structure, which suggests that positive selection occurs in domains responsible for DNA binding and polymerization rather than the NAD catalytic domain. Taken together, our results indicate that vertebrate NAD metabolism is still undergoing functional diversification.},

abstract = {Enzymes involved in the last steps of NAD biogenesis, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NadD) and NAD synthetase (NadE), are conserved and essential in most bacterial species and are established targets for antibacterial drug development. Our genomics-based reconstruction of NAD metabolism in the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii revealed unique features suggesting an alternative targeting strategy. Indeed, genomes of all analyzed Acinetobacter species do not encode NadD, which is functionally replaced by its distant homolog NadM. We combined bioinformatics with genetic and biochemical techniques to elucidate this and other important features of Acinetobacter NAD metabolism using a model (nonpathogenic) strain Acinetobacter baylyi sp. ADP1. Thus, a comparative kinetic characterization of PncA, PncB, and NadV enzymes allowed us to suggest distinct physiological roles for the two alternative, deamidating and nondeamidating, routes of nicotinamide salvage/recycling. The role of the NiaP transporter in both nicotinate and nicotinamide salvage was confirmed. The nondeamidating route was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by an ADP-ribose-responsive repressor NrtR. The NadM enzyme was shown to possess dual substrate specificity toward both nicotinate and nicotinamide mononucleotide substrates, which is consistent with its essential role in all three routes of NAD biogenesis, de novo synthesis as well as the two salvage pathways. The experimentally confirmed unconditional essentiality of nadM provided support for the choice of the respective enzyme as a drug target. In contrast, nadE, encoding a glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase, proved to be dispensable when the nondeamidating salvage pathway functioned as the only route of NAD biogenesis.},

Here we report that both the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) biosynthesis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and levels of NAD(+) display circadian oscillations that are regulated by the core clock machinery in mice. Inhibition of NAMPT promotes oscillation of the clock gene Per2 by releasing CLOCK: BMAL1 from suppression by SIRT1. In turn, the circadian transcription factor CLOCK binds to and up-regulates Nampt, thus completing a feedback loop involving NAMPT/NAD(+) and SIRT1/CLOCK:BMAL1.},

abstract = {Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by a mechanism that is still poorly understood. Here we show using metabolomics that NNMT impairs the methylation potential of cancer cells by consuming methyl units from S-adenosyl methionine to create the stable metabolic product 1-methylnicotinamide. As a result, NNMT-expressing cancer cells have an altered epigenetic state that includes hypomethylated histones and other cancer-related proteins combined with heightened expression of protumorigenic gene products. Our findings thus point to a direct mechanistic link between the deregulation of a metabolic enzyme and widespread changes in the methylation landscape of cancer cells.},
