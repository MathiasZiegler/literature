\subsection{Supplementary figure S1}

\textbf{The structurally unresolved loop structure of NamPRT.} Sequence alignment of NamPRT of different species cropped to the region around the unresolved loop structure. Coloured rectangles indicate the enzymes present in the species besides NamPRT; blue: NNMT; black: NADA and NNMT; yellow: NADA; green: NamPRT only. Major clades are indicated for better orientation. Number of amino acid indicated at the top refer to the human protein.
