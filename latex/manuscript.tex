\section{Summary}

NAD is best known as cofactor in redox reactions, but it is also substrate of NAD-dependent signalling reactions that consume NAD and release nicotinamide (Nam). In eukaryotes, two different Nam salvage pathways exist. While in lower organisms the initial deamidation of Nam is prevalent, in animals the direct conversion of Nam to the mononucleotide by Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT) dominates and eventually remains as the single Nam recycling route in vertebrates.
Strikingly, loss of the deamidation pathway in early vertebrates is accompanied by the occurrence of a new enzyme that marks Nam for excretion by methylation – nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). The physiological relevance of NNMT is still enigmatic. Why is there an enzyme that removes Nam from recycling, seemingly not having any other physiological role? And why is the occurrence of NNMT accompanied by a diversification of NAD-consuming enzymes?
We have used mathematical modelling approaches to resolve these counterintuitive observations. Our results indicate that NNMT is required to enable high NAD consumption fluxes necessitated by the increasing diversification of NAD-dependent signaling pathways. This kinetic regulation requires a high substrate affinity of the key enzyme for Nam salvage, NamPRT. Indeed, the affinity of NamPRT to Nam has previously been measured to be in the nanomolar range. Mathematical modelling supports the hypothesis that NNMT exerted an evolutionary pressure on NamPRT enforcing the development of its unusually high substrate affinity. Using multiple sequence alignments, we identified a sequence insertion, first occurring in vertebrates, that parallels an - experimentally verified - increase in the substrate affinity of the enzyme. Further simulations show that the deamidation pathway became obsolete owing to the high substrate affinity of NamPRT. Collectively, our results illustrate a close evolutionary relationship between NAD biosynthesis and the diversification NAD-dependent signaling pathways, potentially driven by the concomitant occurrence of a regulator of Nam salvage, NNMT.

\subsection{Comments and parts of old version not included yet}

Chordata: NADA disappears. These analyses also support the view that Tunicata and Branchiostoma are not part of the phylum chordata\todo[author=Mathias]{Is this view in any way argued upon by anyone??}.

In the evolutionary context, an additional question arises: Why do only a few organisms, mostly less complex animals, possess the gene for NADA in addition to NamPRT and NNMT. When including NADA into the simulations, we see that the effect of NADA on NAD consumption is very limited in the presence of NNMT (old Figure 4F) even at high expression levels (see old Suppl. Figure S1C and D) and could be compensated by increased expression of NamPRT (not shown).

Until this point we have neglected compartmentalisation of the pathway. We do however know from previous studies that in early vertebrate development a compartmentalisation of the pathway has occurred reflected by a gene triplication of NMNAT and the occurrence of compartment-specific domains called ISTIDs (Lau, 2010). Looking at the evolutionary timepoint \todo[author=Toni]{This time point can only be reconstructed, but is unknown. I think a figure with the likely reconstruction would help to follow the argumentation} of appearance of NNMT and the gene triplication of NMNATs, we see that NNMT occurs prior to the gene triplication and the first occurrence of ISTIDs and we have confirmed this in our own analysis (not shown).
